            <h3>Title: The Journey Begins</h3>

            Once upon a time in a quiet village nestled between green hills, lived a young dreamer named Aryan. He often sat by the riverside, watching the clouds drift by, imagining the world that lay beyond the mountains.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            One morning, filled with courage and curiosity, Aryan packed a small bag, whispered goodbye to his family, and set off on his journey. He walked through deep forests, crossed wide rivers, and met people with stories as colorful as the skies.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            After many seasons, Aryan returned. He was no longer the boy who left, but a man shaped by the world. Though the village looked the same, everything felt different. His heart was full, his dreams now real.
